# Parkheim – Find parking before you lose your mind

## Description

Parkheim is a full-stack parking management system built to make finding and managing parking less
painful for everyone involved. It includes two apps—User and Admin—both built with Flutter.
Originally powered by a custom Dart server (shelf), Parkheim later migrated to Firebase for
real-time functionality, because who doesn’t love rewriting backends mid-project?

## Features

### User App

- Authentication
- Manage parking sessions, parking spaces, and vehicles
- Real-time updates across devices
- Push notifications for ending/extending parking—because forgetting isn´t free
- Dark and Light Mode—choose your mood while finding parking

### Admin App

- Authentication
- Manage parking spaces and availability
- View parking statistics, revenue, and most popular spots (and feel the power)
- Real-time updates for all changes

## Project Scope

Built over four months as an exercise in full-stack Flutter, backend flexibility, and real-time data
handling—while staying just on the edge of sanity.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- Flutter – One codebase to rule them all
- BloC – State management that’s as organized as my code pretends to be

### Backend

- Dart (shelf) – Initial custom API server, handcrafted with love (and some stack traces)
- Firebase – Migration for real-time updates, authentication, and syncing everything that moved

## Test Data

Some generated Swedish social security numbers for testing:

- 19900101-1239
- 20011231-5676
- 19871020+2345

⚠️ For testing only. These numbers are not linked to real individuals. Please use responsibly—or
I´ll send the parking enforcement bots.

## Status

Project is complete and serves as proof that Flutter can handle real-world full-stack use cases, and
that I can survive multi-month dev cycles with sanity mostly intact.
